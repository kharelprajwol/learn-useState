1. The useSate Hook allows us to create, update and manipulate state inside functional components.

2. What is state?
-- States are the variables that hold data that our components depend on and may change over time.
-- Whenever these variables change, React updates the UI by re-rendering the component in the DOM with the current values
   of the state variables.

3. useState hook takes a single argument: an initial value for the state. Then it returns an array of two values:
-- state variable
-- and a funtion to update state

Example:
             const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

-- Here, initial value for our state is set to 0, as 0 is passed as argument in useState.
-- The array returned by useState is destructed, so our state value is the variable: count, and out state updater
   function is setCount function.

4. The state updater funtion is used while handling events, to update state's vaue and to make our page dynamic because once state value is updated, out UI automatically get re-rendered
